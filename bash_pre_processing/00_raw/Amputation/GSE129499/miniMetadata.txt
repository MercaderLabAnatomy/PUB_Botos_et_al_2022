Construction protocol: 4-HT-treated Tg(cmlc2:creER;cmlc2:nRSGG), 4-HT-treated Tg(cmlc2:nRSGG), grl5nt-/- and wild-type ventricles at 7 dpa were collected. Total RNAs of the ventricles were isolated using TRIzol Reagents and quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system. Libraries were constructed according to the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit Protocol followed by quality check with Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system.

Study Type: Transcriptome Analysis
Abstract: As Grl/Hey2 directly binds DNA through E box motifs and mediates transcription repression, we aim to gain insights into potential target genes of Grl/Hey2 during heart regeneration. We performed RNA-seq analyses using total RNAs collected from 4-HT-treated Tg(cmlc2:creER;cmlc2:nRSGG) hearts and Tg(cmlc2:nRSGG) control hearts, as well as grl5nt-/- mutant hearts and wild-type hearts following ventricular resection at 7 dpa. Using RNA profile analyses, we have identified some potential genes act downstream of Grl/Hey2-dependent transcriptional repression during heart regeneration. Overall design: Transcriptome profiles of 4-HT-treated Tg(cmlc2:creER;cmlc2:nRSGG) hearts and Tg(cmlc2:nRSGG) control hearts, as well as grl5nt-/- mutant and wild-type hearts following ventricular resection at 7 dpa were generated by next generation sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Six hearts were pooled per biological replicate. Each group had three biological replicates.
