Library:
Instrument: Illumina NovaSeq 6000
Strategy: RNA-Seq
Source: TRANSCRIPTOMIC
Selection: cDNA
Layout: PAIRED
Construction protocol: Sham surgeried and resected zebrafish ventricles were collected, flash frozen on dry ice, and RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent. NEBNext Single Cell_Low Input RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina was used with 200 ng of total RNA for the construction of sequencing libraries.

Study Type: Transcriptome Analysis
Abstract: In contrast to mammals, the adult zebrafish hearts can regenerate within a short period. Upregulation of major vault protein (Mvp) expression after ventricle resection. To determine the impact of loss of mvp on transcriptome during heart regeneration, we pursued transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) on wild type and mvp mutant zebrafish hearts at 7 day-post-amputation. Overall design: We perform ventricle resection or sham surgeries to adult wild type and mvp mutant zebrafish hearts. At 7 days post amputation, ventricle samples were collected in triplicate for RNA-seq.
