Library:
Instrument: BGISEQ-500
Strategy: RNA-Seq
Source: TRANSCRIPTOMIC
Selection: cDNA
Layout: SINGLE
Construction protocol: RNA was extracted using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) phenol cholorform extraction. RNA quality was determined using an Agilent BioAnalyzer. RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using the low-input poly-A BGISEQ-500RSRNASeq(Transcriptome) protocol.

Study Type: Transcriptome Analysis
Abstract: A Yap knockout zebrafish line was used to observe how loss of Yap affects cardiac regeneration. Overall design: Cryoinjury or sham surgeries were performed on 6-12 month old zebrafish ventricles. At 7 days post injury, whole hearts were collected and RNAseq was performed.
