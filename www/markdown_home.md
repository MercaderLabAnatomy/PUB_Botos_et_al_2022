###	**Abstract**

##### Zebrafish have the capacity to fully regenerate the heart after an injury, which lies in sharp contrast to the irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes after a myocardial infarction in humans. Transcriptomics analysis has contributed to dissect underlying signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks. Heart regeneration can be studied in response to different types of injuries. The three more broadly used techniques are ventricular resection, ventricular cryoinjury, and genetic ablation of cardiomyocytes. To which extent these different types of injuries elicit an equivalent regenerative response is still unclear.  Here, we present a meta-analysis of transcriptomic data of regenerating zebrafish hearts in response to these three injury models. We reanalyzed and batch corrected 36 samples distributed in seven datasets and analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEG) followed by downstream analysis of Gene Ontology Biological Processes (GO:BP). We found that the three injury models share a common core of DEG encompassing genes involved in cell proliferation and the Wnt signaling pathway. We also found injury-specific gene signatures for resection and genetic ablation, and to a lower extent the cryoinjury model.  Interestingly, the DEG analysis also led to specific GO:BP. Our results identify a gene expression signature common to all analyzed models but also highlight the importance to consider injury-specific gene regulatory networks when interpreting results on cardiac regeneration in the zebrafish.
